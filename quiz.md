1. Polymorphism means something can have many forms. 

2. In OOP plymorphism generally relates to many forms of objects being used in a certain function or method. A common way for this to happen is when objects are related to each other through inheritance. E.g. an animal superclass can have the sub-classes of more specific animals and all of these animals perform the same method i.e. move but do it in a different way. An object with many forms.

3. We can use superclasses, abstract classes (inheritance) or use interfaces.

4. As many as it wants.

5. An example would be: in can be used when a general calculation needs to be performed on a 'form' of user or customer. Like in banking if you need to charge interest on a but each user has a different interest rate, polymorphism would come in handy because the same calc can be used but is implemented differently on each subclass.

6. Composition refers to the structure of a program being composed of classes rather than inherited classes. Inheritance works on the 'IS' basis whereas composition works on the 'HAS' basis. 

7. When you want to build something tha has lots of parts. E.g. a car is made up of lots of part so it makes sense to give the car these parts (an engine, windows, doors) and when these are given to the car the car takes ownership of eacj of it's parts.

8. It can stop the code getting too messy like if we use inheritance. It uses other parts to gain the behaviour it needs. Using composition allows reusable code because it does not exist just by association. Inheritance only allows on class to be extended, this makes it rather inflexible whereas composition can use as many as needed.

9. The objects are not all destroyed, they can be used by other packages.
